Create Spotify playlist from last.fm recommendations.


# Warning
#### This project is still in development.


# Usage
You need to create an API key for [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) and [Spotify application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).\
Then you will need to enter fill the config.ini file. (Running it once should generate it).\
The access token for spotify will be generated later.
